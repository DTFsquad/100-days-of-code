# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 0: Octomber 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: After taken an online video package course with a provider I decided that way of training is not helping me at all. That was a tryout for the past almost 2 years. Today I decided to undertake some serios training for the next couple of months, followed by a JOB guarantee programme by one of the providers in London UK. Hoppefully by March 2019 I will do all the steps to be in that position to take a Junior Web Developer Role.

**Thoughts** Started FreeCodeCamp.org curriculum and I will work on this basis until 15 January 2019 or sooner. If I will finish the curriculum early then mid January I am planning to start The Odin Project modules to reinforce the knowledge gained.

### Day 1: Octomber 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've STARTED the Responsive Web Design Certification which is aprox 300 hours to go thru. 
                      I did just 2 challanges today. 
                      I will need to raise up the challanges learned per day in order to have a proper understanding of the full module by the end of the week.
                      I need to get my head into the basics and hit the ground running with all frontEnd by the end of the year 2018.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, with plans to LEARN/PRACTICE as much as possible everyday. I started this challenge in between my daily work routine (e-mails, calls and everything in between). I hope I can keep up with doing the challanges and build the portfolio in my work breath moments and a bit at home when I dont fell that tired.

### Day 2: Octomber 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just couple of challenges finished today. I will need to speed up my learning each day in order to have a full grasp on the FrontEnd side until the end of December in order to get on board with Job Guarantee programme on Just IT.

**Thoughts** Not a great start in my first day as learning. Being at work over weekend, sometimes I try to learn sometimes in between work task and I get caught up with work chores.

### Day 3: Octomber 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I just had a look at one challange.

**Thoughts** I had just one challange solved as I had a day off and I was caught with home chores and personal life. Need to go past the daily life and have at leat 30 mins to 1 hour everyday of coding.

### Day 4: Octomber 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day off, No progress.

**Thoughts** When I have a work day I find that I can progress with my learning to code, as opposite to my days off when I plan what to do, including to practice code but I end up by not doing to much or anything at all.

### Day 5: Octomber 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the "Basic HTML and HTML5" from the "Responsive Web Design Certification". I will go ahead to study the "Basic CSS"

**Thoughts** Today I did managed to work towards the challanges in freeCode Camp more then 30 mins. I did not stayed the all 30 mins continuos, but instead I did it in sprints of around 5 mins each on in between the work day (I work in a call center, so can be quite busy some times).

### Day 6: November 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I did managed to finish the Basic CSS challanges and moved on to the Applied Visual Design Challenges.

**Thoughts** Basic HTML and CSS was quite fun and simple to understand. I hope I will grasp the future challanges with the same ease and fun. Great start of the month with incresead state of mind and progression. I did managed in the last 2 days to overcome my lazy mindset and got at least 30 mins of coding challanges. Will continue to study the module of basic training and hopefully I will start the module final projects by the end of the week. Today was an extra good day with lots of challanges done (around 70) and lots of new stuff learned.

**Today's Progress**: Today I did managed to finish 12 challanges
**Thoughts** I do think that I can do better in the matter of the knolodge and number of challanges learned everyday. Until know I did enjoyed every bit of learning in these module.

### Day 8: November 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just one challange passed today
**Thoughts** Being in my day off I tend to lean over and not doing the work for the day. I need to inprove the daily imput of challanges even in days off.
