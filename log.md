# 100 Days Of Code - Log 



### Day 0: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After 2 years, searching online and inclass courses, to aid me in learning web dev I decided I need to take on my own way. Self taught web dev is the new way.

**Thoughts** Started FreeCodeCamp.org curriculum front end challanges. 
             Plan to commit everyday to GitHub a blob from my solutions on #FCC. 
             Small steps everyday. 
             Planning to get a job in web dev in London by the end of the year.
