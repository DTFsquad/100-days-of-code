# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 0: Octomber 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: After taken an online video package course with a provider I decided that way of training is not helping me at all. That was a tryout for the past almost 2 years. Today I decided to undertake some serios training for the next couple of months, followed by a JOB guarantee programme by one of the providers in London UK. Hoppefully by March 2019 I will do all the steps to be in that position to take a Junior Web Developer Role.

**Thoughts** Started FreeCodeCamp.org curriculum and I will work on this basis until 15 January 2019 or sooner. If I will finish the curriculum early then mid January I am planning to start The Odin Project modules to reinforce the knowledge gained.

### Day 1: Octomber 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've STARTED the Responsive Web Design Certification which is aprox 300 hours to go thru. 
                      I did just 2 challanges today. 
                      I will need to raise up the challanges learned per day in order to have a proper understanding of the full module by the end of the week.
                      I need to get my head into the basic and hit the ground running with all front end by the end of the year 2018.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, with plans to LEARN/PRACTICE as much as possible everyday. I started this challenge in between my daily work routine (e-mails, calls and everything in between). I hope I can keep up with doing the challanges and build the portfolio in my work breath moments and a bit at home when I dont fell that tired.

### Day 2: Octomber 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts** Not a great start in my first day as learning. Being at work over weekend, sometimes I try to learn sometimes in between work task and I get caught up with work chores.
